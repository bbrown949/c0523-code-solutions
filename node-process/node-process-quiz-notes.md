## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a computer process?

A process or running process refers to a set of instructions currently being processed by the computer processor. For example, in Windows you can see each of the processes running by opening the Processes tab in Task Manager.

- Roughly how many computer processes are running on your host operating system (Task Manager or Activity Monitor)?
  200
- Why should a full stack Web developer know that computer processes exist?
  As a system administrator, the most important thing to keep in mind is that each process running on a computer will consume the system's resources, either the available memory or CPU time. So, the more processes you run, the slower your computer may seem as you consume more of the available resources.
