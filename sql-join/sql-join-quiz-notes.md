## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a foreign key?
  a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table.
- How do you join two SQL tables? (Provide at least two syntaxes.)
  using a join clause
- How do you temporarily rename columns or tables in a SQL statement?
  alias column names using as
- How do you create a one-to-many relationship between two tables?
  a foreign key in one table pointing to a primary key in another table, creates a one-to-many relationship between the two tables.
- How do you create a many-to-many relationship between two tables?
  Many-to-many relationships can be modeled by introducing a 3rd "join table" that contains a foreign key to one of the tables and another foreign key to the other table.
